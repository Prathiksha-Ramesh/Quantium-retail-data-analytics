# Quantium Retail Analytics: Customer Segmentation & Trial Impact Evaluation

This project simulates a real-world retail analytics engagement conducted as part of the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience (Forage)**. It leverages transaction data from a fictional FMCG retailer to generate actionable insights into customer segmentation, product performance, and trial campaign evaluation—informing strategic decisions in pricing, promotions, and product mix.

##  Project Summary

**Client:** Fictional FMCG Retailer  
**Category:** Chips  
**Objective:** Identify key customer segments, optimize SKU strategy, and assess the effectiveness of a marketing trial in driving sales uplift.

---

##  Business Challenges Addressed

1. **Which customer segments are most valuable to the chips category?**
2. **What pack sizes and products resonate with high-performing segments?**
3. **Was the marketing trial effective in increasing sales, and should it be scaled?**

##  Actionable Insights & Recommendations

- **Customer Segmentation**
  - **Mainstream young singles/couples** emerged as the most lucrative segment, contributing over **35% of total category revenue**.
  - This segment showed a strong affinity for **175g packs**, indicating a preference for personal-sized consumption.

- **SKU Strategy**
  - **175g packs** were consistently top-performing across demographics.
  - Larger SKUs (330g–380g) underperformed, suggesting limited traction outside of family segments.
  - Recommendation: Optimize shelf space and promotional focus toward **high-engagement SKUs** (e.g., 175g, 150g).

- **Trial Campaign Evaluation**
  - The marketing trial resulted in a **15–20% uplift in sales** at the trial store compared to three demographically matched control stores.
  - Statistical testing confirmed significance (**p < 0.0005**) across all comparisons.
  - Recommendation: **Scale the trial strategy** to stores with similar baseline profiles and consider **extending the trial duration** for long-term ROI validation.
